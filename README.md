# Quantifying astrophysical uncertainties in the Galactic dark matter distribution 

Here we make availabe the likelihood profile of the full data-driven analysis presented in Benito et al. (in prep.)

### Brief Description

Benito et al. (in prep.) quantifies astrophysical uncertainties that affect the determination of the distribution of dark matter (DM) in the Milky Way (MW) by means of the rotation curve (RC) method.
The input elements of our analysis are:
* [galkin](https://github.com/galkintool/galkin) compilation for the observed RC of our Galaxy;
* large array of observationally inferred three-dimensional density profiles for each baryonic component (stellar bulge, stellar disc and interstellar gas);
* DM halo described by a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) density profile.

We perform a full marginalization over uncertainties on the Galactic parameters and over the lack of knowledge on the morphology of the baryonic components of the Galaxy. You can find a complete description of the analysis in Benito et al. (in prep.).


The full likelihood of our analysis is released in a tabular form (**4dgrid.dat**) over multidimensional grid in the parameters characterizing the DM distribution, namely the scale radius Rs, the scale density ρs, the inner slope of the profile γ and the Sun's galactocentric distance R0.

### Applications

The likelihood can be used to include the effect of uncertainties in the DM distribution in the MW while interpreting results of searches for an indirect DM signal in gamma-rays or neutrinos, from the Galactic center (GC), or the halo region surrounding it.

Further applications involve the interpation of results from local DM searches, like direct detection and anti-matter observations, or global fits combining local and GC searches.
